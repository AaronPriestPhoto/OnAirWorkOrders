I'd like to create a Python script to connect to OnAir Airline Manager via API and download jobs from FBOs at airports in my OnAir company to chain into profitable work orders for idle planes in my company fleet. I'd like the api keys in a separate file that is protected in .gitignore from syncing to my Github project. But let's do this slowly, one step at a time. First, let's get the API connection figured out and download jobs from FBOs in my OnAir company to a SQLite database, and then we'll move on to the next stage once we have that task done.
